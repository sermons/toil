## Toil of Love [(1Thes2)](# "ref")
1. Clean **Heart** [(v3-6)](# "ref")
1. **Mother's** Gift [(v7-9)](# "ref")
1. **Father's** Encouragement  [(v10-12)](# "ref")

---
For our appeal does not spring from <br>
**error** or **impurity** or any attempt to **deceive**, 

[1 Thessalonians 2:3 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
but just as we have been **approved** by God <br>
to be **entrusted** with the gospel, <br>
so we speak, not to please **man**, <br>
but to please **God** who **tests** our hearts. 

[1 Thessalonians 2:4 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
For we never came with <br>
words of **flattery**, as you know, <br>
nor with a pretext for **greed** --<br>
God is witness. 

[1 Thessalonians 2:5 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
Nor did we seek **glory** from people, <br>
whether from you or from others, <br>
though we could have made **demands** <br>
as apostles of Christ. 

[1 Thessalonians 2:6 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
But we were **gentle** among you, <br>
like a nursing **mother** <br>
taking care of her own children. 

[1 Thessalonians 2:7 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
So, being **affectionately** desirous of you, <br>
we were ready to **share** with you not only <br>
the **gospel** of God but also our own **selves**, <br>
because you had become very **dear** to us.

[1 Thessalonians 2:8 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
For you remember, brothers, our **labor and toil**: <br>
we worked **night and day**, that we <br>
might not be a **burden** to any of you, <br>
while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. 

[1 Thessalonians 2:9 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
You are witnesses, and God also, how <br>
**holy** and **righteous** and **blameless** <br>
was our conduct toward you believers. 

[1 Thessalonians 2:10 (ESV)](# "ref")

---
For you know how, like a **father** with his children, <br>
[12](# "ref")
we **exhorted** each one of you <br>
and **encouraged** you and **charged** you <br>
to **walk** in a manner **worthy** of God, <br>
who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.
