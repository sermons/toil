+ During pandemic, been easy to become **isolated**
+ Not just bc **social dist**, but so much **divis** + anger
+ Know many **hurting**, but don't know **how** to reach out
+ **We** ourselves are hurting, tired, and weak:
  + **doubts** about our faith,
  + **limited** in our love,
  + **struggling** in holy living

  + That You sent **Son** to redeem us: You are **worthy**
  + That You **entrust** us with this gospel: it is **worth it**
+ Open our **ears**, eyes, hearts to receive Your exhortation
  + Equip us to **proclaim** Your gospel with our lives

+ Theme: **FHL**. ch1: thxgv for Thes' **faith**

  + the **in-road** / manner amongst them
+ Not **boasting** about self! Repeat. 2 **witnesses**:
  + **God** exam. heart; **you** yourselves know

+ Only **scratch** surface: inspire you to study **deeply**
  + As HS reveals **richness**
  + **discuss** w/family, smgp, church
+ v3-6: mostly **negative**, how **not** do to missions
+ Some preach **false** gospel in name of Christ
  + or **true** gospel out of **impure** motives: personal gain
+ Underst. God **sees** through this very **clearly**
  + **Right** way and **wrong** way to preach gospel
+ 2 **triplets**: root + fruit

For our appeal does not spring from <br>
**error** or **impurity** or any attempt to **deceive**, 

我們的勸勉不是出於錯誤，<br>
不是出於污穢，也不是用詭詐。

[1 Thessalonians 帖撒羅尼迦前書 2:3 (ESV/CUV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Even Paul had **motives** questioned! (**Christ**, too)
+ *Error* : wandering, as opposed to the **truth**
  + Making stuff **up**, or unconsc. affec by **pop culture**
  + Antidote: deeply **immersed** in Scripture
+ *Impurity* : filthy, as opposed to **clean**
  + **Immoral**, unethical, covering secret sin
  + Antidote: remember God's **holiness**
+ *Deceive* : **bait**: appears beneficial but **traps**
  + **Feel-good** msg to **inflate** own numbers, or **control**
  + Anti: **whole** gosp, not just comfort promises
+ 2nd triplet: **fruit**: character as share gospel

---
For we never came with <br>
words of **flattery**, as you know, <br>
nor with a pretext for **greed** -- God is witness. <br>
Nor did we seek **glory** from people

因為我們從來沒有用過諂媚的話，<br>
這是你們知道的；<br>
也沒有藏著貪心，<br>
這是神可以作見證的。

[1 Thessalonians 帖撒羅尼迦前書 2:5 (ESV/CUV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ How we **were** / became, when among you
+ *Flattery*: vacuous / false enc for personal **gain**
+ Pretext for *greed*: excuse / cover for selfishness:
  + Hope to gain **money**, influence, security
+ *Glory* from people: **admiration**, approval:
  + that others say: "See what a **good** Chr he is!"
  + or **fear** others say: "not **spiritual** enough!"
+ We **do** seek a reward, but not from man,
  + but **God**, who examines our hearts:

---
but just as we have been **approved** by God <br>
to be **entrusted** with the gospel, <br>
so we speak, not to please **man**, <br>
but to please **God** who **tests** our hearts. 

但神既然驗中了我們，把福音託付我們，<br>
我們就照樣講，不是要討人喜歡，<br>
乃是要討那察驗我們心的神喜歡

[1 Thessalonians 帖撒羅尼迦前書 2:4 (ESV/CUV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Gospel not **invented** by man, but **given** to us by God
+ As we put our **trust** in Him, 
  + God deems us **trustworthy** of handling it accurately
+ So we **pass on** this message of life, 
  + striving to be **worthy** of this trust

---
## (clean hearts)
>>>
+ As I **prepare** to share gospel, **examine** own heart:
+ Do I **study** the Bible honestly + deeply? 
  + Not only know God's grace, but have **exp** it?
+ Do I seek no **gain** for self? 
  + No money, no thx, no admiration, but only
  + **reward** of sharing in Father's happiness?
+ What is my **motivation** for proclaim name of Christ?

But we were **gentle** among you, <br>
like a nursing **mother** <br>
taking care of her own children. 

只在你們中間存心溫柔，<br>
如同母親乳養自己的孩子

[1 Thessalonians 帖撒羅尼迦前書 2:7 (ESV/CUV)](# "ref")

+ *Gentle* : older manuscripts: **babies** (diff one letter)

So, being **affectionately** desirous of you, <br>
we were ready to **share** with you not only <br>
the **gospel** of God but also our own **selves**, <br>
because you had become very **dear** to us.

我們既是這樣愛你們，<br>
不但願意將神的福音給你們，<br>

因你們是我們所疼愛的

[1 Thessalonians 帖撒羅尼迦前書 2:8 (ESV/CUV)](# "ref")

+ You became **beloved** to us, w/deep **yearning**

  + life of **Christ**, from **my** life to **yours**
+ w/**vulnerability**, warmth, deep affection

---
For you remember, brothers, our **labor and toil**: <br>
we worked **night and day**, that we <br>
might not be a **burden** to any of you, <br>
while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. 

弟兄們，你們記念我們的<br>
辛苦勞碌，晝夜做工，<br>
傳神的福音給你們，<br>
免得叫你們一人受累

+ **Tentmaking**: normal, honest work, not partic. "spiritual"
  + to pay own **bills** so church doesn't have to support
+ Two **extremes** in misunderstanding role of **work**:
+ (1) all work is **sinful**, materialistic, worldly
  + Serving God means full-time **pastor** / missionary
  + **Dichot** btwn "holy" church volunt. on weekends
  + and "real" work at M-F job

## Labour and Toil 做工跟辛勞
+ "All work is **sinful**" <br> 所有的工作是 **罪惡** 的
+ "All work is **holy**" <br> 所有的工作是 **聖潔** 的

>>>
+ (2) all work is **holy**: 
  + Succ. in **job** means succ. in Chr walk
  + **Prayers** revolve around **my** acad./career goals
  + If job **doesn't** work out: must be **failure**
  + either of **my** spirituality or **God's** faithf.
+ Paul talks very little about his **tents**: 
  + won any awards, **excel**, was biz good or not
+ Primary purpose: not to **burden** the church
+ Devoted self to hard **labour** + toil on 2 fronts:
  + not only to earn own **living**, but
  + to **proclaim** gospel of God

---
## (work hard, care deeply)
>>>
+ Proclaim good news of Chr's salv. not just **wknd** work,
  + special **evangel** mtgs, or **STM**.
+ We must learn from those who have **mothered** us:
  + Mother's **gift** is her own **life**
+ As Christ poured out His **life** into our hearts,
  + we give completely of **ourselves** for others
  + that they may **grow** in the life of Christ
+ e.g., son's **env** primarily us @home: want to
  + struct. home life around God's **truth**, but
  + demonstr. **grace** + forgiveness daily
+ Extend **outward** to world **dying** for real love
